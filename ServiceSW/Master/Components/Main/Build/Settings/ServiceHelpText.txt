513010300;ERR_Retort_Levelsensor_Heating_Overtime;Retort: Level sensor did not reach target temperature in time. Please check whether there is any dirt or residue on the level sensor and clean if necessary. If nothing is found, please check O-ring of level sensor or exchange level sensor.
513010312;ERR_Retort_Levelsensor_Heating_Overtime_NoTissue;Retort: Level sensor did not reach target temperature in time. This occured during self test at process start or during cleaning steps. Please check whether there is any dirt or residue on the level sensor and clean if necessary. If nothing is found, please check O-ring of level sensor or exchange level sensor.
513010320;ERR_Levelsensor_temperature_overrange_with_tissue;Retort: Level sensor temperature is out of range. This occured during processing. Please check whether there is any dirt or residue on the level sensor and clean if necessary. If nothing is found, please check O-ring of level sensor or exchange level sensor.
513010332;ERR_Levelsensor_temperature_overrange_NoTissue;Retort: Level sensor temperature is out of range. This occured during self test at process start or during cleaning steps. Please check whether there is any dirt or residue on the level sensor and clean if necessary. If nothing is found, please check O-ring of level sensor or exchange level sensor.
513040011;ERR_LA_BottleCheck_PressureBuild_Failed;Bottle check: Pressure needed for bottle check cannot build up. Please check for bad sealing function on retort lid & seal, as well as for malpositioning of rotary valve (on tube position instead of sealing position).
513040012;ERR_LA_BottleCheck_Failed_Empty;Bottle check: A bottle or wax bath is detected as empty. Please check for a unfilled or missing bottle. Also check for any leakage in the liquid- and air system as well as for bad sealing function on retort lid & seal.
512040013;ERR_LA_BottleCheck_Failed_Insufficient;Bottle check: A bottle or wax bath is detected as insufficiently filled. Please check for a  insufficiently filled or poorly connected bottle. Also check for smaller leaks in the liquid- and air system as well as for bad sealing function on retort lid & seal.
513040020;ERR_LA_Precheck_Sealing_Failed_Pressure;Air System: Pressure did not reach target value during pre-test.
Please refer to the log file to find detailed data. Check for leakages on retort lid seal (e.g. through paraffin residues) and on hoses and connectors in the air system.
513040161;ERR_LA_Filling_Insufficient;Liquid and Air System: A bottle or wax bath is filled with an insufficent amount of reagent. Please check if the reagent station or wax bath was filled to the correct level or if it was manually removed while the retort was just being filled.
513040163;ERR_LA_Filling_Insufficient_Cleaning;Liquid and Air System: A station is filled with an insufficent amount of reagent. Please check if the according station was filled to the correct level or if it was manually removed while the retort was just being filled.
513040203;ERR_LA_Protocol_Draining_TimeOut_BulidPressure_Cleaning;Liquid and Air System: Draining of retort content back to a station failed due to the needed target pressure was not built up in time. Please check the air system for any leak. Also check for bad sealing function on retort lid & seal. If no leak found, check the proper function of pressure sensor, air valves and pump.
513040201;ERR_LA_Protocol_Draining_TimeOut_BulidPressure_Safety;Liquid and Air System: Draining of retort content back to a station failed due to the needed target pressure was not built up in time. Please check the air system for any leak. Also check for bad sealing function on retort lid & seal. If no leak found, check the proper function of pressure sensor, air valves and pump.
513040122;ERR_LA_Protocol_Filling_TimeOut_4min_Safety;Liquid and Air System: Filling of retort from a station failed during processing! Filling time exceeds 4 minutes. Tube to this station is likely to be restricted or blocked, (potentially by paraffin). Check bottle connector for any blockage and check tube inside bottle for kinks. If no fault found there, please use the station cleaning program. This will flush the tube to this station using the cleaning xylene bottle first, followed by the cleaning alcohol bottle.
513040124;ERR_LA_Protocol_Filling_TimeOut_4min_Cleaning;Liquid and Air System: Retort filling time from station 1% exceeds 4 minutes during processing! Tube to this station is likely to be restricted or blocked, (potentially by paraffin). Check bottle connector for any blockage and check tube inside bottle for kinks. If no fault found there, please use the station cleaning program. This will flush the tube to this station using the cleaning xylene bottle first, followed by the cleaning alcohol bottle.
513020091;ERR_WaxBath_OvenCover_Status_Open_Paraffin;Paraffin Oven: The user opened the paraffin oven cover during a paraffin step. This could potentially have caused the paraffin to solidify. If the paraffin bath was removed, this could have caused a filling or draining error. If no user interaction caused this, check the oven cover sensor for proper function.
513040141;ERR_LA_Protocol_Filling_OverFlow_with_tissue;Retort: Overflow occurred during reagent filling. This happened during processing in a non-paraffin step. Please check the level sensor status and check if the air system (wax-trap, air tubes) is still in normal condition.
513040143;ERR_LA_Protocol_Filling_OverFlow_No_tissue;Retort: Overflow occurred during reagent filling. This happened in a non-paraffin step. Please check the level sensor status and check if the air system (wax-trap, air tubes) is still in normal condition.
513010461;ERR_Lidlock_Close_Status_Error_Protocol;Retort: Please close retort lid and confirm by clicking the retry button. Please check the lid lock for mechanical blockages or any residue. Also check the lidlock sensor for proper function and adjustment.
513010462;ERR_Lidlock_Close_Status_Error_NoTissue;Retort: Please close retort lid and confirm by clicking the retry button. Please check the lid lock for mechanical blockages or any residue. Also check the lidlock sensor for proper function and adjustment.
513040014;ERR_LA_BottleCheck_Failed_Blockage;Bottle check: A station was detected as restricted or blocked during bottle check. Tube to this station is likely to be restricted or blocked (potentially by paraffin). Check bottle connector for any blockage and check tube inside bottle for kinks. If no fault found there, please use the station cleaning program. This will flush the tube to this station using the cleaning xylene bottle first, followed by the cleaning alcohol bottle.
513050501;ERR_ASB5_Current_OutofRange_with_tissue;Retort or Paraffin Oven heating: Function of heating pad is incorrect during a protocol. Please check the heating wire and measure resistance of the heating pads. If OK, exchange ASB5. If not OK, exchange retort or oven accordingly.
513050502;ERR_ASB5_Current_OutofRange_no_tissue;Retort or Paraffin Oven heating: Function of heating pad is incorrect before or after a protocol. Please check the heating wire and measure resistance of the heating pads. If OK, exchange ASB5. If not OK, exchange retort or oven accordingly.
513040303;ERR_LA_Releasing_TimeOut_with_tissue;Air System: Releasing of pressure has failed during processing. Residual pressure is existent inside retort and/or air module. First, disconnect tube from the pressure sensor and so check its proper function (should then display ambient pressure). If functioning fine, check for a blockage of the air-system, e.g. air-valves, rewstricted tubes or wax-trap.
513010601;ERR_Retort_heating_overtime;Retort heating: Retort heating cannot reach the target temperature  in 15 minutes.  Please check the heating function of Retort by using the according test in service mode. Check Retort insulation, heating and sensor cables and connectors according to service manual. Exchange either Retort, temperature sensor or ASB5.
511040221;ERR_LA_Draining_TimeOut_Empty_2min;Draining of retort to a station failed during processing or cleaning! Draining time exceeds 2 minutes. Tube to this station is likely to be restricted or blocked (potentially by paraffin). Check bottle connector for any blockage and check tube inside bottle for kinks. If no fault found there, please use the station cleaning program. This will flush the tube to this station using the cleaning xylene bottle first, followed by the cleaning alcohol bottle.
